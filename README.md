## Clue

**Status**: Functional (check GitHub issues for details on planned improvements)

**Description**: The computer player will tell you what suggestions to make (guesses at the answer to the mystery), when and what to accuse (once it is certain of the answer), and which cards to show people if they make a suggestion and it gets to you. All you need to do is initialize it by providing information about the players and your cards, then keep it updated as the game progresses about suggestions that are made and their results as well as which rooms you can suggest. It will keep track of all this information and narrow down the possibilities until it is knows the answer.
